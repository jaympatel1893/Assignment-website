# Assignment-website
This is a website I made as a pre-requisite and interview assignment for ACM co-web master post.

DEMO:  //link

The assignment was to replicate a simple website called Brad Young Photography. 
It was made in 2013, as my beginning to web dev, just out of 1st year of my engineering.
